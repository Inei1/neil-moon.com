Company Overview

Google (Alphabet) — Large-scale, data-driven technology company operating global infrastructure, consumer products, and internal platforms supporting billions of dollars in operational spend.

Role: Engineering Resident (Software Engineer equivalent, L3 scope)

Tenure: 2020–2021
Program: Google Engineering Residency (two 20-week rotations)
Role Context: Engineering Residents perform the same work as entry-level Software Engineers (L3), rotating across teams to build production systems and demonstrate readiness for full-time SWE roles.

General Focus Areas:

Backend systems

Data pipelines

Internal tooling

Reliability and correctness of production systems

Working within large, legacy Google codebases

Core Technologies:

SQL (BigQuery, SQLP)

Go (Rotation 1)

Java (Rotation 2)

Google internal frameworks (Spanner, Blaze/Bazel)

Rotation 1: Marketing Email Automation Workflow

Problem Context:
At the time, sending certain marketing emails required manual engineering involvement for each send. This created delays, increased coordination overhead, and did not scale with growing marketing needs.

My Contribution:
I built an entirely new backend workflow to automate the data preparation and triggering required for marketing email campaigns.

Key responsibilities included:

Identifying, validating, and debugging upstream internal data sources needed for email generation

Fixing inconsistencies or correctness issues in those data sources when required

Designing and implementing SQL-based data processing pipelines to reliably produce inputs for marketing workflows

Integrating the pipeline into Google’s internal infrastructure so that it could run repeatedly without engineering intervention

Business Impact (Inferred / Estimated):

Reduced marketing turnaround time by an estimated ~70%

Eliminated repeated manual engineering work previously required for each campaign

Saved hundreds of engineering hours per month by removing humans from a previously manual process

Enabled marketing teams to operate more independently

The system is believed to still be in production today, indicating long-term value and maintainability

Skills Demonstrated:

Translating non-technical business workflows into automated systems

Debugging and correcting upstream data dependencies

Building production-grade internal tooling with SQL-heavy pipelines

Designing for repeatability and operational simplicity

Rotation 2: RCS (Android) Integration Test Sample Report

Team Context:
Worked within Google’s RCS (Rich Communication Services) Android organization, focused on ensuring correctness and reliability of a new system replacing a deprecated legacy one.

Problem Context:
A legacy Java system previously acted as the “source of truth” for a specific report, but:

The system was deprecated

It was no longer actively used

The codebase was poorly written and difficult to reason about

Despite this, the team needed high confidence that the new system’s output was correct. To achieve this, they required an automated integration test (“push on green”) that could validate outputs against a known reference.

My Contribution:
I:

Dug into the deprecated legacy Java codebase to identify the true logic responsible for generating the report

Isolated and understood the minimal subset of logic that actually defined the output

Reimplemented that logic cleanly in a brand-new Java service

Produced a deterministic sample report used as part of an automated integration test pipeline

Outcome:

Enabled reliable automated verification of the new system

Reduced uncertainty around correctness during rollout

Removed dependence on an unreadable, deprecated legacy system

Improved team confidence in production deployments

Skills Demonstrated:

Navigating large, legacy codebases to find “source of truth”

Distilling complex, poorly structured logic into clean, minimal implementations

Writing production Java services intended specifically for testing and validation

Improving system reliability through automated integration testing

Conversion to Full-Time Software Engineer (L3)

After successfully completing the Engineering Residency program, I converted to a full-time Software Engineer role at Google.

Role: Software Engineer (Full-Time) — Datacenter Hardware Pricing

Team Context:
Internal infrastructure team responsible for determining and forecasting the prices of Google’s datacenter hardware — covering hardware purchases worth billions of dollars.

System Overview:

Large-scale SQL-driven data pipeline

Runs daily, with special quarterly runs serving as the financial “source of truth”

Processes millions of rows

End-to-end runtime of 5+ hours

Directly feeds finance forecasting and planning models

Bugs or inaccuracies could materially impact financial decisions

My Responsibilities:

Maintain and extend a mission-critical pricing pipeline

Participate in on-call rotations supporting 4–5 related teams

Diagnose and fix correctness, performance, and reliability issues

Work closely with the finance team as primary internal customers

Key Contributions:

Correctness & Pricing Logic Improvements

Identified cases where hardware configurations without prior purchase history produced invalid or missing prices

Reworked pricing logic to generate valid, defensible prices for these scenarios

Improved pipeline robustness and coverage across hardware SKUs

High-Severity Bug Resolution

Investigated a rounding error that caused unexpected price changes during a quarterly run

The issue triggered a multi-team war room due to downstream financial impact

Successfully isolated the root cause and implemented a fix, stabilizing future runs

Performance Optimization

Used built-in profiling tools to analyze pipeline performance

Identified an expensive computation step taking ~1 hour that no longer affected outputs due to earlier logic changes

Removed unused calculations, reducing total pipeline runtime by approximately 1 hour

Improved overall efficiency and reduced operational risk for long-running jobs

Finance Collaboration & Ad-Hoc Analysis

Met weekly with finance stakeholders who depended on the pipeline outputs

Provided support when finance teams were blocked

Produced custom reports when asked to analyze data over alternative time horizons

Business Impact:

Improved accuracy and trust in financial forecasting inputs

Reduced risk of costly planning errors

Increased pipeline reliability for a system underpinning billions of dollars in spend

Helped finance teams move faster with fewer interruptions

Skills Demonstrated:

Data engineering at scale

Production debugging under pressure

Performance profiling and optimization

Cross-functional collaboration with finance stakeholders

Ownership of critical internal infrastructure without formal leadership authority

SOURCE: Professional Experience — ParentHero
Company Overview

ParentHero — Pre-seed consumer health startup focused on providing parenting support from pregnancy through the first years of a child’s life. Product emphasized evidence-informed content, tracking tools, and accessibility across web and mobile.

Role: Founding Engineer (Sole Engineer)

Tenure: Nov 2023 – Dec 2025
Role Context: Sole engineer responsible for building, maintaining, and operating the entire product end-to-end. Worked directly with the founder and occasionally with a small content team. No direct interaction with end users; feedback was mediated through the founder, medical advisors, and beta testing.

Ownership Scope:

Full-stack web and mobile application

Backend services and APIs

Data modeling and persistence

Cloud infrastructure and deployments

Security and privacy protections

Performance, reliability, and operational debugging

High-Level Technical Stack

Frontend:

Next.js

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

CapacitorJS (web → mobile app)

Backend:

TypeScript

PayloadCMS 3 (Next.js-based)

PostgreSQL

Prior system: Strapi (fully migrated away)

Infrastructure:

AWS ECS / EC2

VPC

S3

Lambda

Autoscaling

Pre-signed URLs for secure asset access

System Architecture & Constraints

I designed the system architecture myself and was responsible for all implementation decisions outside of the initial Next.js and Strapi choices, which predated my involvement.

Key constraints:

Consumer health domain with strict medical disclaimers

HIPAA-adjacent and child data protection requirements

Sensitive personal and child-related data

Very tight runway and pressure to ship quickly

To address data sensitivity, I implemented a tokenization / detokenization system so that:

Sensitive user data was never stored in plaintext

A database compromise would not yield usable personal information

Tokens could be safely joined with operational data only at runtime

CMS Migration: Strapi → PayloadCMS

The original backend used Strapi, which significantly slowed development due to long reload cycles (often 5–10 minutes per change).

I:

Evaluated alternatives

Migrated the entire backend to PayloadCMS

Rebuilt schemas, rich text, access control, and APIs

Integrated PayloadCMS directly with the Next.js app

Reflection:
While the migration improved long-term developer velocity, it consumed more time than ideal for a pre-seed startup. This experience sharpened my judgment around tradeoffs between technical quality and speed-to-market under runway constraints.

Core Product Areas
Article System (End-to-End Feature)

I rebuilt and extended the article system into a production-grade, multi-modal content experience.

Capabilities:

Rich text articles with custom blocks (via PayloadCMS)

Inline images and structured content

Embedded video

Article-specific integrations (e.g., vaccine tracker references)

Text-to-speech audio playback

Text-to-Speech:

Implemented using AWS Polly

Audio generated asynchronously on article updates

Stored in S3 and reused on demand

Designed to avoid runtime latency and control costs

Video Delivery:

Staff-uploaded MP4 videos (typically 6–10 minutes)

Built a custom workflow to transcode MP4 into multi-bitrate HLS streams

Used Shaka Player for playback

Implemented authenticated access using S3 pre-signed URLs

This required building:

Media processing pipelines

Secure delivery mechanisms

A custom video player integration

Tracking Systems (Major Product Differentiator)

I built a suite of tracking tools covering pregnancy, postpartum, and early childhood. While many trackers were CRUD-oriented, several required non-trivial domain logic.

All trackers included:

Structured data entry

Historical views

Analytics and summaries where applicable

Vaccine Tracker (High Complexity)

Dynamically generated recommendations based on:

Child age

Prior vaccination history

Supported missed doses via catch-up logic

Implemented logic based on CDC vaccine schedules

Adjusted future recommendations automatically as history changed

Pregnancy / Postpartum Tracker

Time-based system driven by pregnancy or postpartum week

Delivered contextual information relevant to the current stage

Allowed symptom tracking with historical views

Developmental Milestones

Age-based milestone expectations

Allowed parents to track whether milestones were met

Notified users when milestones were overdue

Provided progress visibility over time

Feeding Tracker

Supported both nursing and bottle feeding

Time-based tracking for nursing

Volume-based tracking for bottle feeding

Side tracking for nursing sessions

Aggregated summaries for daily usage

Infrastructure & Operations

I set up and operated all AWS infrastructure myself.

Key aspects:

ECS-based deployments

Autoscaling configuration

Manual infra management (no IaC)

Database performance and connection pooling

Operational Incident Example:

Diagnosed PostgreSQL transaction pool exhaustion caused by unclosed transactions

Identified the root cause in backend logic

Implemented fixes to prevent recurrence

This required production debugging across application code, database behavior, and AWS infrastructure.

Business Context & Outcome

ParentHero was a pre-seed company with a very limited runway. The product reached beta but did not achieve sufficient traction or funding to continue.

I left when it became clear the company would not progress further.

Framing Note:
While the product did not succeed commercially, the role required building a complete, real-world system under tight constraints, with full ownership across frontend, backend, infrastructure, security, and delivery.

Skills & Signals Demonstrated

End-to-end product engineering

Full-stack TypeScript development

Backend system design

Data privacy and security-conscious design

Media processing pipelines

Cloud infrastructure ownership

Pragmatic decision-making under startup constraints

Analytics & Data Visualization

For every major tracker, I built a dedicated analytics page that allowed users to understand trends over time rather than just raw entries.

Capabilities:

Tabular views of historical tracker data

Custom, tracker-specific graphs built with Recharts

Time-based aggregation (daily, weekly, etc., where applicable)

Domain-specific visualizations depending on the tracker (e.g., volume over time, frequency, milestone progress)

This required:

Designing analytics schemas per tracker

Aggregating and transforming raw event data into visualization-friendly formats

Balancing clarity and performance for mobile and desktop views

Article Engagement Systems

Beyond article rendering, I built multiple systems to support long-term engagement.

Bookmarking & History:

Users could bookmark articles for later reference

Maintained a persistent list of bookmarked articles

Tracked article view history to support:

User recall

Personalization

Recommendation fallback logic

These systems tied directly into the recommendation engine and user profile.

Employer (B2B) System

In addition to direct-to-consumer flows, I built a B2B employer licensing system intended for selling ParentHero as an employee benefit.

Employer Dashboard:

View all employees associated with an employer account

Manage employee access

Monitor license usage

Licensing Management:

Assign and revoke licenses

Control access without exposing consumer subscription logic

Support multiple employees under a single employer entity

This required modeling:

Employer–employee relationships

License states

Permission boundaries distinct from consumer subscriptions

Help & Support Systems

Help Section:

Implemented similarly to the article system

Separate content types and routing

Allowed for structured, searchable help content

Support Requests:

Built a support button that automatically sent a structured support request email

Included relevant user context to reduce back-and-forth

Integrated directly with internal support workflows

User Account & Onboarding Flows

I implemented the full authentication and onboarding lifecycle in coordination with PayloadCMS.

Authentication:

User registration

Mandatory email confirmation

Password reset / forgot password flows

Secure session handling

Onboarding:

Collected child information at account creation

Allowed users to select:

Parenting topics of interest

Account preferences and settings

Used onboarding data to seed personalization systems (recommendations, content feed)

Article Recommendation System (Major Highlight)

One of the most complex systems I built was a context-aware article recommendation engine designed to surface the most relevant content at the right time.

Primary Recommendation Layer (Contextual Tagging):

Pulled live data from every tracker (pregnancy stage, vaccine status, feeding behavior, milestones, etc.)

Translated tracker signals into weighted tags for the user’s feed

Articles were manually tagged by staff with corresponding tags

Recommendations were ranked based on:

Tag relevance

Tag weight

User context (e.g., urgency, recency)

Example:

If a user was due for a vaccine, vaccine-related tags were weighted heavily

Articles explaining that vaccine were promoted prominently

Fallback Strategies:
When contextual signals were insufficient:

Precomputed collaborative filtering

Used historical user–article interactions

Topic-based recommendations

Based on user-selected interests

Article history

Viewed and bookmarked content

This system blended:

Rule-based logic

Data-driven personalization

Editorial control

It was designed to be explainable, tunable by staff, and resilient to sparse user data.

LLM-Based Parenting Chat Interface

I built an AI-powered chat experience inspired by tools like Perplexity AI, focused on trust, traceability, and safety.

User Experience:

Users ask free-form parenting questions

AI responds in natural language

Inline citations appear directly in the response

A source panel displays:

Source URL

Favicon

Short meta description

Technical Approach:

Used OpenAI APIs

Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieved content from:

ParentHero’s vetted premium articles

Curated external parenting and medical sources

Safety & Reliability Measures:

Validated source URLs before inclusion

Automatically excluded hallucinated or broken sources

Ensured citations matched the referenced text

Maintained strict separation between AI-generated content and medical decision-making

This system emphasized:

Transparency

Source credibility

Reduced hallucination risk

Payments & Subscription System (Stripe)

I designed and implemented the entire subscription system using Stripe.

Payment Flow:

Used Stripe Checkout Sessions with embedded payment UI

Allowed for custom-branded checkout experiences

Handled successful and failed payments cleanly

Subscription Management:

Stripe webhooks updated user subscription state

Stored a subscription end date on the user record

Access to premium features was determined entirely by subscription validity

Permission System:

Centralized permission checks based on subscription end date

Enforced premium access across:

Articles

AI chat

Advanced trackers

Analytics

This created a clean separation between:

Payment processing

Authorization logic

Feature access

Additional Signals for Recruiters & EMs

Built a full consumer product solo, across frontend, backend, infra, data, and AI

Shipped under extreme runway pressure

Balanced correctness, privacy, and velocity

Designed systems that were explainable and auditable, not just “clever”

Developed strong judgment around tradeoffs after seeing real-world consequences
